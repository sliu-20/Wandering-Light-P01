## Project Description
Vacation Time is a website dedicated to providing suggestions on vacation time, places, and activities based on user preferences. The user is first directed to a login page where they can either log in to their account or press the register button to register a new account. After logging in, the user is directed to a home page, where they can input and submit some information to get a vacation idea. Not inputting any information and submitting would completely randomize the idea given. The user can save any vacation ideas they like and view these saved ideas in a separate page.
